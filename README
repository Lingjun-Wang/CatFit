Welcome to CatFit!
********************

CatFit is a python project developed by Dr. Lingjun Wang 
(ORCID: 0000-0002-8352-1359) and Hai Yu (ORCID: 0000-0002-1840-8835) to fit the
observed bolometric and multiband light curves of supernovae and other similar
transients. The models are semi-analytical models based on Arnett (1980, 1982),
Arnett & Fu (1989), and Chatzopoulos et al. (2012).
The code was developed during the writing of the following papers:
https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...821...22W/abstract
https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...837..128W/abstract
https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.489.1110W/abstract
and Wang et al. (2022).

1. Software requirements
-------------------------
The user needs to have Python 3.4 or above installed in a Mac, Windows or
Linux machine. The following python packages are utilized in CatFit:
1) scipy, 2) numpy, 3) emcee, 4) matplotlib, 5) astropy, 6) multiprocessing.
These can be easily installed either via the Anaconda python framework or one
of the package managers available for Macosx and Linux platforms (e.g. 
Homebrew, Macports, Fink).

2. Running CatFit
-------------------------
CatFit is designed to be user-friendly.

To run CatFit simply type the following command in a terminal window:

> python multi-interaction.py <demo.conf>

The configuration file is used to specify the fitting parameters. It was 
originally designed for the mcmc code (Wang et al. 2017). The program
produces a file named "output.txt" that is self-explaining for every column
of the data.

3. Troubleshooting
-------------------

The users are welcome to submit bug reports/errors by E-mail to:
wanglingjun@ihep.ac.cn.

4. Repository distribution
----------------------------------------

CatFit can be obtained through a git repository by typing:
> git clone https://github.com/Lingjun-Wang/CatFit
If you make use of CatFit for your publications please reference it
appropriately.
